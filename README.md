Homework Assignment 1

Description
Develop a static course website for an arbitrary university course. Use the Web-representation technologies
and apply standards and best practices discussed during the first three lectures (HTML5, CSS3, accessibility,
responsive design, SEO, good coding style, etc.). The visual appeal of your design is highly welcomed, but no
strict requirements are specified. Yet, avoid deliberately repulsive color combinations. Your website is
expected to present meaningful information about the course. The pages should be bigger than a paragraph,
but smaller than, say, a book chapter.

Requirements
Your website must:

- have at least 5 pages with meaningful content
- use HTML5 semantic attributes for formatting (e.g. see here)
- use images
- have links between pages, within pages, and to external page(s)
- have at least one table
- be optimised for search engines
- use consistent layout and colour scheme
- use CSS for formatting, including at least:
  - several different styles for links
  - several different styles for text
  - styles for table elements
  - cascading styles through selector specificity
  - style inheritance
- define all formatting styles in a separate CSS file
- be compliant with the HTML5 rules of W3C Markup Validation Service and the CSS3 rules of
- W3C CSS Validation Service

- to put it in other words: do not use any of the deprecated HTML elements or attributes
  (see for example here)

- render correctly in the current versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers
- Follow the Web accessibility standard
  - Keyboard compatibility
  - Text to speech
  - Clear layout and design
  - Customizable text
  - Understandable content
- Follow the Responsive Web guidelines
  - Images
  - Content positioning
  - Units of measurement

Maintain good coding style 
- use indentation for nested HTML elements 
- use lower case names for HTML elements and attributes 
- use quotation marks for attribute values 
- always use alt attribute with img elements 
- use meaningful names for CSS classes 
- follow the BEM naming convention for CSS classes 
- short CSS rules can be written on one line, but long rules need to occupy multiple lines 
- use lower case file names

Procedure 
- complete and submit your website in groups 
- a group must be registered with the TA beforehand 
- the website should be archived and submitted as a single zip through the BlackBoard system

Academic integrity
The work should be done by you and your peers only. You can rely on the support of teaching assistants and
student assistants during the practicum time, but you are not allowed to use the code of other groups. It is
also forbidden to use HTML generating services, programs and frameworks like Bootstrap. You are required to
manually create both the HTML and the CSS code. You can use external sources for the content of your
website, however, you must refer to them by linking and naming.
