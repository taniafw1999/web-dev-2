                    <p>Several questions about HW1 were asked today during the break that might benefit from a
                        clarification:</p>

                    <p>Q. Which aspects of Web accessibility standard must it follow? <br />
                        A. The text of the assignment has been updated with the corresponding list.</p>

                    <p>Q. Which aspects of Responsive Web guidelines must it follow?
                        <br />
                        A. The text of the assignment has been updated with the corresponding list.

                    </p>

                    <p>Q. What does it mean "Website must have ... meaningful content"? Can we just fill it with Lorem
                        Ipsum? Can we copy content from somewhere else?<br />
                        A. Lorem Ipsum is not meaningful content. Your Website should have at least 5 pages that a
                        regular course website would have (e.g. Schedule, Instructors, etc.). The topic of the course is
                        up to you. It can be a silly one or it can be a serious one. You can of course copy the content
                        from online sources (I do not expect you to design a course). Just make sure to add a reference
                        to the original source of the content.

                    <p>Hi everyone, we have 184 students out of 200 grouped now, meaning that 14 of you don't have a
                        group. Everyone else has been assigned a group on Blackboard.</p>

                    <p>Everyone who is in a group on Blackboard should see the assignment. If you can't see the
                        assignment or don't have a group yet, please email me ASAP.</p>

                    <p>The first assignment is due in one week so speak now or forever hold your peace. </p>
