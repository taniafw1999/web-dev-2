            <p>
                Internet is the most relevant information technology of our age. World
                Wide Web is its most important application. In this course we will
                learn the architecture of WWW, its main protocols, representation
                formats and development technologies. The practical component of the
                course will focus on the design and implementation of Web
                applications. Additional topics such as Semantic Web, Social Web and
                Adaptive Web will help us better understand current trends of Web
                development.
            </p>

            <p> Course material is roughly divided into 4 learning units:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client representation (Lectures 1-3),</li>
                <li>Client programming (Lectures 4-8),</li>
                <li>Server programming (Lectures 9-13),</li>
                <li>Trends of Web Development (Lectures 14-16).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Course prerequisites</h3>
            <p>
                The course has no formal prerequisites. However,
                basic knowledge of programming are expected. Although this is an introductory
                course, many students taking it have had experience with some aspects of Web
                development. If you do not have any knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
                you definitely can still get a high grade in the course, but you will need to work
                hard for it.
            </p>

        <section class="content__para">
            <h3>Working methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Lectures.</em> Most of the course material is delivered through standard
                    lectures accompanied by PowerPoint slides. Lectures take place twice
                    a week. After each lecture, its slides are made available on the
                    course page.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Practical classes.</em> Practical classes follow the lectures and are conducted by teaching
                    assistants. They can help you find answers to practical questions
                    and progress with your homework assignments.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Homework assignments.</em> Homework assignments are set out to help you
                    practice knowledge acquired during lectures. They are done in groups
                    of 3. You are responsible for forming your group. Homework will
                    gradually develop, thus you will be able to reuse and develop your
                    code throughout the course. Keep in mind, that assignment 3 is much
                    more challenging than the first two. You are given enough time to
                    complete it, make sure to start using this time as soon as possible.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Exams.</em> The course has two main exams: the midterm and the final. The
                    midterm covers the material of the first 8 lectures. The final
                    covers the last 8. Both exams are digital; you will take them in the
                    UU assessment system Remindo. Both exams are closed books. You will
                    have 100 minutes to answer exam questions, if you are a student
                    registered for an extra time during exams, you will have 120
                    minutes. Some exam questions are more practical, and some will
                    verify your knowledge of important concepts and facts.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Additional reading.</em> The course does not have a single textbook. Most
                    Web technology textbooks become obsolete rather fast due to constant introduction
                    of new technologies and evolution of exciting ones. Instead, plenty of online
                    resources structured around course topics are made available for you. You are
                    are not required to read all the suggested resources. They are there to help you
                    understand challenging topics and ensure you have enough points of reference
                    to complete homework assignments.
